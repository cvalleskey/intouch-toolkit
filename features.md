# Features

## Grid

- Generate a grid based on established responsive CSS grids for pixel-perfect column and margin rendering.

## Padding

- Generate shapes which define the inner padding for elements within a group.

## Typographic Scale (to-do)

- Generate text styles for headers and body text from a set of configuration properties that can easily be translated into CSS.

## Auto Superscript

- Continuously looks for usage of the ^ symbol in selected text layers and converts any text following it into superscript. When editing text, the caret becomes visible again for easy editing. Supports symbol overrides.

## Export to PDF from JPGs

- Generate PDFs by first exporting each artboard as a JPG and then placing it into a PDF. Useful when Sketch's built-in PDF export feature produces glitches.
