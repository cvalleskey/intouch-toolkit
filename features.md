# Features

## Grid

- Generate a grid based on established responsive CSS grid for pixel-perfect column and margin rendering.

## Padding

- Generate shapes which define the inner padding for elements within a group.

## Typographic Scale (to-do)

- Generate text styles for headers and body text from a set of configuration properties that can easily be translated into CSS.

## Export to PDF from JPGs
